# npm-yarn
A Replacment helper for npm it uses yarn for all npm commands


## Why?
There was a point in time where some tools hardcoded npm usage but i needed to use yarn so i needed to replace the systems npm executeable with something that used yarn under the hood. It was Really hacky but worked today this is not needed anymore
